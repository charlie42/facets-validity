# Inter-rater and test-retest reliability
# Inter-rater:
# For each item, compare values between two teachers rating the same student
# ICC: 
#   random effects (want to generalized to new raters)
#   both agreement and consistency
#   multiple rater for school, for hospital not sure - both
#   one-way (since not the same raters rating all participants, but not so far from two-way)
